        <h3>Full Stack Developer</h3>
        <h2>About Me</h2>
<p>
  I'm Rakesh Samanta, a computer science student specializing in full-stack development. My journey into the world of coding began with a fascination for solving problems through technology. Over the years, I've honed my skills in both front-end and back-end development, working with languages and tools like JavaScript, Python, React, Node.js, and more. 

  I believe in continuous learning and am always eager to take on new challenges that push my limits. Whether it's building dynamic web applications, designing user-friendly interfaces, or optimizing performance, I strive to create solutions that not only meet but exceed expectations. 

  When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring the latest tech trends, contributing to open-source projects, or learning something new to enhance my skill set. My goal is to become a proficient software developer and to contribute to projects that make a meaningful impact.
